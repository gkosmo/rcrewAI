# Code Review Crew

This example demonstrates an automated code review system using specialized AI agents that analyze code for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, code quality, and documentation completeness. The system provides comprehensive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

## Overview

Our code review crew consists of:
- **Security Analyst** - Identifies vulnerabilities and security best practices
- **Performance Specialist** - Analyzes code efficiency and optimization opportunities  
- **Code Quality Reviewer** - Ensures coding standards and maintainability
- **Documentation Specialist** - Reviews and improves code documentation
- **Integration Tester** - Validates integration patterns and testing coverage

## Complete Implementation

```ruby
require 'rcrewai'
require 'json'

# Configure RCrewAI for code analysis
RCrewAI.configure do |config|
  config.llm_provider = :openai
  config.temperature = 0.2  # Lower temperature for consistent analysis
end

  ## Executive Summary
  
  The code review identified several areas requiring attention across security, performance, 
  code quality, documentation, and testing. While the code functions correctly, there are 
  important improvements needed before production deployment.
  
  ## Critical Issues Found
  
  ### üî¥ High Priority (Fix Immediately)
  - **SQL Injection Vulnerability** - Direct string interpolation in SQL queries
  - **Hardcoded API Keys** - Sensitive credentials in source code
  - **Missing Authorization** - No access control on user data endpoints
  - **Mass Assignment Vulnerability** - Unfiltered parameter updates
  
  ### üü° Medium Priority (Fix Before Production)
  - **N+1 Query Problem** - Inefficient database access patterns
  - **Missing Error Handling** - No exception handling for external API calls
  - **Insufficient Test Coverage** - Critical security scenarios not tested
  - **Performance Inefficiencies** - Expensive operations in loops
  
  ### üü¢ Low Priority (Improvement Opportunities)  
  - **Missing Documentation** - Method documentation incomplete
  - **Code Organization** - Opportunities for better structure
  - **Naming Conventions** - Some inconsistencies in naming
  
  ## Review Details by Category
  
  #{completed_reviews.map do |review|
    category = review_categories[review[:task].name]
    "### #{category}\n**Status:** Completed\n**Report:** #{review_reports[review[:task].name]}\n"
  end.join("\n")}
  
  ## Recommendations for Development Team
  
  ### Immediate Actions Required
  1. **Fix Security Vulnerabilities** - Address all high-priority security issues
  2. **Remove Hardcoded Secrets** - Move API keys to environment variables
  3. **Add Authorization Checks** - Implement proper access controls
  4. **Sanitize Database Queries** - Use parameterized queries or ORM methods
  
  ### Process Improvements
  1. **Automated Security Scanning** - Integrate tools like Brakeman or CodeQL
  2. **Performance Monitoring** - Add APM tools to catch performance issues
  3. **Code Quality Gates** - Implement automated quality checks in CI/CD
  4. **Security Training** - Team training on secure coding practices
  
  ## Quality Metrics
  
  - **Security Score:** #{security_issues ? 'C-' : 'Not Available'} (Critical issues found)
  - **Performance Score:** #{performance_issues ? 'C+' : 'Not Available'} (Multiple inefficiencies)  
  - **Code Quality Score:** #{quality_issues ? 'B-' : 'Not Available'} (Good structure, needs cleanup)
  - **Test Coverage:** Estimated 40% (Insufficient for production)
  - **Documentation Coverage:** Estimated 30% (Needs significant improvement)
  
  ## Next Steps
  
  1. **Developer Review Meeting** - Discuss findings with development team
  2. **Priority Issue Fixing** - Address critical and high priority items first
  3. **Process Integration** - Integrate automated code review into workflow
  4. **Follow-up Review** - Schedule review after fixes are implemented
  
  ## Tools and Resources Recommended
  
  ### Security Tools
  - **Brakeman** - Rails security scanner
  - **bundler-audit** - Gem vulnerability checking
  - **OWASP ZAP** - Dynamic security testing
  
  ### Performance Tools  
  - **Bullet** - N+1 query detection
  - **Rack Mini Profiler** - Performance profiling
  - **New Relic/DataDog** - APM monitoring
  
  ### Code Quality Tools
  - **RuboCop** - Ruby style and quality checker
  - **Reek** - Code smell detection
  - **SimpleCov** - Test coverage analysis

  **Next Review Date:** #{(Date.today + 14).strftime('%B %d, %Y')}  
  **Review Type:** Follow-up after issue remediation

## Advanced Code Review Features

### 1. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**
Each specialist focuses on their expertise area:

```ruby
security_analyst     # OWASP Top 10, vulnerability analysis
performance_specialist  # Algorithmic complexity, bottlenecks
quality_reviewer        # Clean code, maintainability  
documentation_specialist # Technical writing, completeness
testing_specialist      # Coverage, integration patterns
```

### 2. **Parallel Review Process**
All review areas are analyzed simultaneously:

```ruby
# All review tasks run in parallel
security_review_task.async = true
performance_review_task.async = true  
quality_review_task.async = true
documentation_review_task.async = true
testing_review_task.async = true
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Reporting**
Generates detailed reports for each area plus consolidated summary:

- Individual specialist reports
- Executive summary with priorities
- Action items with effort estimates
- Tool recommendations
- Follow-up schedule

### 4. **Actionable Recommendations**
Each finding includes specific remediation steps:

```ruby
# Example security finding
"SQL Injection Vulnerability in UserController#create
Risk: Critical
Fix: Replace string interpolation with User.create(user_params)
Effort: 2 hours"
```

## Integration Patterns

### CI/CD Integration
```ruby
# Add to your CI pipeline
class CodeReviewPipeline
  def self.review_pull_request(pr_files)
    review_crew = CodeReviewCrew.new
    review_crew.analyze_files(pr_files)
    
    if review_crew.has_critical_issues?
      fail_build_with_report(review_crew.report)
    else
      post_review_comments(review_crew.suggestions)
    end
  end
end
```

### IDE Integration
```ruby
# Real-time code analysis
class IDECodeReview
  def analyze_on_save(file_path)
    quick_review = CodeReviewCrew.new(mode: :quick)
    issues = quick_review.analyze_file(file_path)
    
    display_inline_warnings(issues)
  end
end
```

### Team Workflow Integration
```ruby
# Slack notifications for review results
class ReviewNotifier
  def notify_team(review_results)
    if review_results.has_critical_issues?
      send_urgent_slack_message(review_results.critical_issues)
    end
    
    create_jira_tickets(review_results.action_items)
  end
end
```

This automated code review system provides comprehensive analysis across all critical dimensions of code quality, helping teams identify and fix issues before they reach production while maintaining high development velocity.

# Research & Development

This example demonstrates a comprehensive research and development workflow using RCrewAI agents to conduct scientific research, perform literature reviews, generate hypotheses, design experiments, and analyze results. The system supports both academic research and industrial R&D processes.

## Overview

Our research and development team includes:
- **Literature Review Specialist** - Comprehensive research and citation analysis
- **Research Scientist** - Hypothesis generation and methodology design
- **Data Analysis Expert** - Statistical analysis and interpretation
- **Experiment Designer** - Experimental protocols and validation
- **Technical Writer** - Documentation and publication preparation
- **Research Coordinator** - Project management and strategic oversight

## Complete Implementation

```ruby
require 'rcrewai'
require 'json'
require 'csv'

# Configure RCrewAI for research and development
RCrewAI.configure do |config|
  config.llm_provider = :openai
  config.temperature = 0.4  # Balanced for scientific rigor and creativity
end

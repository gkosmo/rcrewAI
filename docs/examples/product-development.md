# Multi-Stage Product Development

This example demonstrates a comprehensive product development workflow using RCrewAI to coordinate multiple specialized teams through the entire product lifecycle - from initial concept to market launch. Each team has distinct expertise and responsibilities that contribute to successful product delivery.

## Overview

Our product development organization includes:
- **Product Strategy Team** - Market analysis, requirements, and roadmap
- **Design & UX Team** - User experience and interface design  
- **Engineering Team** - Technical architecture and implementation
- **Quality Assurance Team** - Testing, validation, and quality control
- **Marketing Team** - Go-to-market strategy and launch execution
- **Project Management** - Coordination, timelines, and delivery

## Complete Implementation

```ruby
require 'rcrewai'
require 'json'

# Configure RCrewAI for product development
RCrewAI.configure do |config|
  config.llm_provider = :openai
  config.temperature = 0.4  # Balanced creativity and precision
end

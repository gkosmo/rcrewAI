# Production-Ready Research Crew

This example demonstrates a fully-featured, production-ready crew that showcases all of RCrewAI's advanced capabilities including intelligent agents, tool usage, memory, error handling, and monitoring.

## Scenario

We'll build a comprehensive market research crew that:
1. Researches market trends using web search
2. Analyzes competitor data from files
3. Generates detailed reports with insights
4. Creates presentation materials
5. Monitors performance and handles errors

## Complete Implementation

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'rcrewai'
require 'logger'
require 'fileutils'

# Production logging setup
logger = Logger.new('crew_execution.log')
logger.level = Logger::INFO

puts "üöÄ Starting Production Market Research Crew"
puts "=" * 50

# Configuration with error handling
begin
  RCrewAI.configure do |config|
    config.llm_provider = :openai  # Switch to :anthropic, :google as needed
    config.temperature = 0.1       # Low temperature for consistent results
    config.max_tokens = 2000       # Reasonable limit
    config.timeout = 120           # 2 minute timeout
  end
  
  puts "‚úÖ LLM Configuration: #{RCrewAI.configuration.llm_provider} (#{RCrewAI.configuration.model})"
rescue RCrewAI::ConfigurationError => e
  puts "‚ùå Configuration failed: #{e.message}"
  puts "Please check your API key environment variables"
  exit 1
end

## Running the Production Crew

### Prerequisites

1. **Set up environment variables**:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
# or  
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-key"
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
bundle install
```

3. **Run the crew**:
```bash
ruby production_crew.rb
```

### Expected Output

The crew will generate:

```
output/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ market_analysis.json      # Structured data analysis
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ executive_report.md       # Professional report
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentations/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ market_research_presentation.md  # Slide content
```

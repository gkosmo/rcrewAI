# Hierarchical Crew with Manager Coordination

This example demonstrates RCrewAI's hierarchical execution mode where a manager agent coordinates and delegates tasks to specialist agents. This pattern is ideal for complex workflows requiring coordination, delegation, and strategic oversight.

## Overview

We'll create a software development crew with:
- **Project Manager**: Coordinates team and delegates tasks
- **Backend Developer**: Handles server-side development tasks  
- **Frontend Developer**: Manages user interface development
- **QA Engineer**: Ensures quality and testing
- **DevOps Engineer**: Manages deployment and infrastructure

The manager will intelligently delegate tasks based on agent expertise and coordinate the overall project execution.

## Complete Implementation

```ruby
require 'rcrewai'

# Configure RCrewAI
RCrewAI.configure do |config|
  config.llm_provider = :openai  # or your preferred provider
  config.temperature = 0.2       # Lower temperature for more consistent coordination
end

# Create hierarchical crew
software_team = RCrewAI::Crew.new("software_development_team", process: :hierarchical)

  ## Task Execution Phases
  
  The manager organized tasks into efficient execution phases:
  
  #{results[:results].group_by { |r| r[:phase] }.map do |phase, tasks|

  ## Key Achievements
  
  ‚úÖ System architecture designed with scalability in mind
  ‚úÖ Backend API implemented with proper error handling  
  ‚úÖ Database optimized for performance
  ‚úÖ Frontend UI created with excellent UX
  ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing strategy developed
  ‚úÖ Production deployment pipeline established
  ‚úÖ All components integrated successfully
  
  ## Recommendations
  
  Based on the hierarchical execution, the manager recommends:
  1. Continue using async execution for independent tasks
  2. Maintain clear task dependencies to optimize workflow
  3. Regular coordination meetings for complex integrations
  4. Implement automated quality gates in the CI/CD pipeline

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. **Manager Coordination**
The project manager:
- Analyzes task dependencies and creates execution phases
- Delegates tasks to specialists based on expertise matching
- Monitors progress across multiple concurrent streams
- Makes strategic decisions about task prioritization

### 2. **Intelligent Delegation**
```ruby
# Manager automatically delegates based on:
# - Agent role and expertise keywords
# - Tool availability and requirements  
# - Current workload and capacity
# - Task complexity and dependencies

# Backend tasks ‚Üí Backend Developer
# UI tasks ‚Üí Frontend Developer  
# Testing tasks ‚Üí QA Engineer
# Deployment tasks ‚Üí DevOps Engineer
```

### 3. **Async Coordination**
```ruby
# Tasks execute in coordinated phases:
# Phase 1: Architecture (foundation)
# Phase 2: Backend API + Database (parallel)
# Phase 3: Frontend UI (depends on backend)
# Phase 4: Testing (depends on implementation)
# Phase 5: Deployment (depends on testing)
# Phase 6: Integration (depends on all components)
```

### 4. **Failure Management**
The manager handles failures intelligently:
- Retries transient failures
- Reassigns failed tasks to other qualified agents
- Adjusts execution plan based on bottlenecks
- Provides detailed failure analysis

## Advanced Coordination Patterns

### Human-in-the-Loop Management
```ruby
# Manager with human oversight for critical decisions
project_manager = RCrewAI::Agent.new(
  name: "senior_pm",
  role: "Senior Project Manager",
  goal: "Coordinate complex projects with stakeholder input",
  manager: true,
  human_input: true,                      # Enable human collaboration
  require_approval_for_tools: false,      # Manager can use tools freely
  require_approval_for_final_answer: true # Human reviews project decisions
)
```

### Dynamic Team Scaling
```ruby
# Add specialists based on project needs
if project_requires_mobile?
  mobile_developer = RCrewAI::Agent.new(
    name: "mobile_developer",
    role: "Mobile App Developer", 
    goal: "Create native mobile applications",
    tools: [mobile_dev_tools]
  )
  
  software_team.add_agent(mobile_developer)
end

if project_requires_ml?
  ml_engineer = RCrewAI::Agent.new(
    name: "ml_engineer", 
    role: "Machine Learning Engineer",
    goal: "Implement ML models and data pipelines",
    tools: [ml_tools]
  )
  
  software_team.add_agent(ml_engineer)
end
```

### Multi-Manager Hierarchy
```ruby
# Large projects can have multiple manager layers
engineering_manager = RCrewAI::Agent.new(
  name: "engineering_manager",
  role: "Engineering Manager", 
  manager: true,
  allow_delegation: true
)

product_manager = RCrewAI::Agent.new(
  name: "product_manager",
  role: "Product Manager",
  manager: true, 
  allow_delegation: true
)

# Both managers coordinate different aspects
crew.add_agent(engineering_manager)  # Technical coordination
crew.add_agent(product_manager)      # Product coordination
```

## Performance Optimization

### Concurrent Execution
- Independent tasks run in parallel
- Dependencies are automatically resolved  
- Resource usage is optimized across agents
- Manager monitors and balances workload

### Intelligent Task Routing
- Tasks routed to most qualified agents
- Workload balanced across team members
- Expertise matching improves quality
- Reduced coordination overhead

## Running the Example

1. **Setup:**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

2. **Execute:**
   ```bash
   ruby hierarchical_crew_example.rb
   ```

3. **Expected Output:**
   - Detailed manager coordination logs
   - Task delegation decisions
   - Phase-by-phase execution progress
   - Individual task results
   - Comprehensive project summary
   - Generated project artifacts

This hierarchical pattern is perfect for:
- **Complex Software Projects**: Multi-component development
- **Enterprise Workflows**: Requiring coordination and oversight  
- **Multi-Disciplinary Teams**: Different expertise areas
- **Quality-Critical Projects**: Needing management oversight
- **Large-Scale Operations**: Requiring delegation and coordination

The manager agent acts as an intelligent orchestrator, making strategic decisions about task delegation while maintaining oversight of the entire project workflow.

# Customer Support Automation

This example demonstrates an intelligent customer support automation system using RCrewAI agents. The system handles multi-channel customer inquiries, provides intelligent responses, manages escalation workflows, and maintains a comprehensive knowledge base.

## Overview

Our customer support system includes:
- **Support Triage Agent** - Initial inquiry classification and routing
- **Technical Support Specialist** - Complex technical issue resolution
- **Customer Success Manager** - Account management and relationship building
- **Knowledge Base Manager** - Documentation and FAQ maintenance
- **Escalation Coordinator** - Managing complex cases and handoffs

## Complete Implementation

```ruby
require 'rcrewai'
require 'json'

# Configure RCrewAI for customer support
RCrewAI.configure do |config|
  config.llm_provider = :openai
  config.temperature = 0.3  # Lower temperature for consistent support responses
end
